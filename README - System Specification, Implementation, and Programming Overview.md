Secure Low-Power Bus Encoder & Attack-Resistant Architecture | Final Project 

• Architected and implemented a novel Bus Encoding algorithm on Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA to minimize switching activity and reduce dynamic power dissipation on high-capacitance off-chip buses.. 

• Developed a Hardware-Software Co-design verification environment, interfacing a Python-based controller with the FPGA via UART for real-time performance validation. 

• Conducted rigorous power analysis using hands – on hardware experiments and Vivado Power Analyzer,demonstrating a measurable reduction in Hamming Distance and switching noise. 

• Optimized RTL code for resource utilization (LUTs/Flip-Flops) and achieved successful timing closure at target operating frequencies. 


System Architecture
Microcontroller: ADuC841 (High-Performance 8052 Core).

Language: Embedded C.

IDE: Keil uVision.

Key Modules:

main.c: Core system logic and task scheduling.

bus_encoder.c: Implementation of the encoding algorithms.

peripherals.c: Hardware abstraction layer for UART, Timers, and I/O initialization.

header.h: Global definitions, macros, and function prototypes.

Implementation Details
The firmware is structured to ensure efficient real-time performance:

Hardware Initialization: Configures the internal clock, UART for serial communication, and GPIO pins.

Data Acquisition: Reads input signals from the bus or sensors.

Encoding Logic: Processes the raw data into an encoded format suitable for transmission.

Transmission: Sends the processed data via UART/Bus interface with parity and error control.
